# Scripts

To avoid extra dependencies, we generate some types manually using these scripts.

To run them, you'll need `rust-script`! Install it using: `cargo binstall --no-confirm --force rust-script`; afterward, ensure `rust-script` is on your path.

Then, `cd` to this directory and type `./SCRIPT_NAME.rs`.
